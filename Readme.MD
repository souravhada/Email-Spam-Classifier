# Spam Classifier Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Spam Classifier project repository! In this project, I'm developing a spam classifier using the UCI Spambase dataset. The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam and non-spam (ham) emails.

## Dataset
The UCI Spambase dataset consists of a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. It contains various features extracted from these emails, such as the frequency of certain words, characters, and other characteristics.

## Implemented Models

### Logistic Regression

### Naive Bayes

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Decision Trees


## Current Progress
Currently, I'm actively working on developing the spam classifier. The project is in progress, and I'm conducting exploratory data analysis, preprocessing the dataset, and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to find the most suitable one for this task.
